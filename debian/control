Description: documentation generator for OCaml (standalone tool)
 Odoc is a documentation generator for the OCaml programming language.
 It reads doc comments contained in OCaml source code, delimited with
 (** ... *), and produces HTML.
 .
 Odoc's main advantage over ocamldoc is an accurate cross-referencer,
 which handles the complexity of the OCaml module system. Odoc also
 offers a good opportunity to improve HTML output compared to ocamldoc.
 .
 Furthermore, odoc can be used by dune to generate documentation of
 OCaml projects using dune as a build-system.
 .
 This package contains the odoc tool.
